- [How I prototype a Web Page](https://flaviocopes.com/how-prototype-webpage/) - I really liked the title! I followed what he had done but went a slightly different way.
- [Designing with Tailwind CSS: Setting up Tailwind and PostCSS - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21HuwjmuS7A&feature=youtu.be) - An **_excellent_** tutorial on Tailwind by Adam Wathan
